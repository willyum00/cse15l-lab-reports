# Lab 3 Report

## Part 1: Bugs

1. A failure inducing input for ArrayExamples
```java
@Test 
  public void testReversedInPlace(){
    int[] input = {1, 2, 3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3, 2, 1}, input);
  }
```

2. A non failure inducing input for ArrayExamples
```java
 @Test
  public void testReversedInPlaceEmpty(){
    int[] input = {};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{}, input);
  }
```

3. A screenshot of the symptom
   
   ![image](https://github.com/willyum00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/81535097/2b7ed3e2-9982-40fc-854d-94da0ae629c3)

4. The bug

Original Code:
```java
   static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
Fixed Code:

```java
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2 ; i += 1) {
      int j = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = j;
    }
  }

```

The bug in the original code was that there was no way for the "end" of the reversed version of the array to be filled. Halfway through the for loop, the array would repeat the first half of itself rather than reverse. I added a temporary variable to store the indexed value of the array and place it at the end, effectively swapping the front and end repeatedly. 


## Part 2: Researching Commands

I will be focusing on the grep command. 

The syntax for the grep command: 
```
grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
```

So an example input would be 

```
grep "beagle" dogs.txt
```

The options I will be focusing on here are:

1. -i, ignore case
2. -v, invert match
3. -w
4. -c

I found these from codecamp's Grep Command in Linux â€“ Usage, Options, and Syntax Examples article. 
Link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/grep-command-in-linux-usage-options-and-syntax-examples/#:~:text=Grep%20is%20a%20useful%20command,a%20powerful%20command%20to%20use.


I will give two examples for each of these options. 

1. -i (Note for these examples I was in the 911report directory)

```

What the above example is doing is it is finding any instance of the string "old" in the lines of file chapter-3.txt. It will return the line even if "old" is not a standalone word, but part of a word, such as "told" or "bold." Because I use the -i option, the capitalized OLD is returned as well. This could be useful for detecting patterns in a corpus, where we are not so worried about actual words as we are about strings of text. 

```
$ grep -i "evolves" chapter-3.txt
            COUNTERTERRORISM EVOLVES
```

The above example is finding any instance of the string "evolves" in the file chapter-3.txt. Unlike "old", there's only one instance of "evolves," and it is capitalized, but because we are using the -i option, the line is returned. This is of course useful if I want to find a particular word in a text file but can't remember if it is in the middle or start of a sentence, so ignoring case could solve that worry. 


2. -v invert match

```
grep -v "a" chapter-3.txt

```

In the above example, we are getting the invert match for the string "a". In other words, we are returning any line that DOES NOT have "a" in it. This could be useful for if we need to find outliers in a repetitive text file. 

For every following example, I am in the ./technical directory

```
$ grep -v "e" biomed/1468-6708-3-4.txt

```

As with the previous example, we are returning every line that does not have the string "e" in it. Because "e" is such a common vowel, using it like this could help us analyze corpus and vowel usage statistics.

```

in the above example, we are only returning lines that have the word "a" in it, so it will not return a line just because it has a word that includes the letter a in it. This is especially contrasted against the previous example of grep with "old" which would return lines with the words "told" or "bold." If we are interested in particular words, which we usually are, -a is a useful option. 


```
$ grep -w "Jaime" government/Media/Anthem_Payout.txt
said Jaime Odle Harmon, executive director of the Lexington-based
```

As in the previous example, this example shows how we can be more precise with finding words in a text with the -w option. 


4. -c: count the number of occurences of a pattern

```
$ grep -c "e"  government/Media/Anthem_Payout.txt
102
```

This option doesn't return any lines from the text, but returns an integer count of how many times the letter "e" occurs in the text file. This is especially helpful if we want to create a statistical analysis of a body of text's usage of certain vowels. 


```
$ grep -c -e "three days" -e "their stuff" government/Media/Fire_Victims_Sue.txt
2
```

Here, we are using the -c option to return the number of times the strings "three days" and "their stuff" appear in the same line. Which actually happens twice in the article. This is useful for if we want to capture redundancies in a body of text, or if we want to find unexpected patterns in our text. For this last example, I inputted the prompt "what are some useful applicaitons for the -c option for grep" into ChatGPT, and it showed an example of using -c with the -e option to flag specifying multiple patterns. This was its output:

```bash
1. Counting Multiple Patterns: You can count the occurrences of multiple patterns in a file by using grep with the -c option and the -e flag to specify multiple patterns.
